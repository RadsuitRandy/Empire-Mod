		<label>Save Our Ship 2 Compatibility Update</label>
		<description>Empire is once again compatible with Save Our Ship 2!</description>

		<patchNoteLines>
			<li>Save Our Ship 2 compatibility has been restored!</li>
			<li>- It can be added to any existing save (but not easily removed)</li>
			<li>- It can be loaded before or after Empire</li>
			<li>- If the space ship is set as the tax delivery map _AND_ tax delivery mode is set to caravan, bad things will probably happen</li>
			<li>- Changing planets may generate red error text. Ignore this! Everything is fine! We're all fine here. How are you?</li>
			<li>- Returning to a previous planet? The Empire's settlements will still be there, ready to pay taxes!</li>
			<li>- SoS2 will prompt the player to decide which allied faction to gift their colonies to when changing planets-- this is referring to the player's colony maps, not Empire settlements.</li>
			<li>   - If the player chooses the option to give their player colonies to their Empire faction, the colonies will be converted to vanilla world settlement objects-- just like it will for any other vanilla faction</li>
			<li>   - Upon returning to the planet, the player will find that this converted settlement object belongs to the empire faction, but is not a manageable, taxable colony</li>
			<li>   - There is no immediate plan to fix this-- just be aware that it will create an extra object on the world map that is not actually a controllable settlement</li>
			<li>- This has been tested thoroughly, but as always notify us via Discord (link above) if you encounter any issues.</li>

		<patchNoteImageDescriptions>
			<li>This release marks the reintroduction of compatibility with Save our Ship 2. In an earlier release, we fixed compatibility with Rim War. Both of these offerings add a new dimension of play to Rim World, expanding the scope of the environments in which a player can build and conquer. Haven't tried either of the other mods before? Give them a search from the Steam Workshop!</li>

		<patchNoteLines>
			<li>- added the option to force open some float menus as suggested by LunaW0lve on our Discord server. (Check the third image for more details!)</li>
			<li>- added translation keys to the settings window</li>
			<li>- added this window, it opens every patch and you can open it from the settings and the actions menu</li>

			<li>- changed road building to be on by default (only applies to new saves)</li>
			<li>- changed how letters generated by random events are displayed for readability as suggested by zuki in our Discord server</li>
			<li>- changed how we handle version numbers</li>
			<li>- fixed pawns acquired from raiding don't have a valid guest tracker. Thanks to SodiumMeal for the report!</li>

		<patchNoteImageDescriptions>
			<li>The new Patch note window. The optimal size for new images is 1366x768. As you can see there are still artifacts making it not look perfect and I don't know why (send help).\nThis entire window took me ~a week of coding, not sure if that's fast or slow, but the ability to show messages like this was really important to me.\nAlso we can maybe reuse this code to make an ingame Wiki for Empire :P\nI'll probably use this in the future to give details on new features that I wouldn't normally put out there, and added some to older patches here too</li>
			<li>A patch note def file. It describes the information contained in a patch note and can easily be used by other mods as well. Though atm Empire would have to be active. The screenshot here is not from the final version.</li>
			<li>Pressing the "Force Open" option seen here will lock the window open, allowing you to make multiple changes without having to open it multiple times.</li>
