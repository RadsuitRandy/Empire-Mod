Empire mod is a mod for Ludeon Studio's topdown base building-exploration game Rimworld
It adds the ability to found your own empire and have colonies not controlled by you give you silver and items, as well as provide you with troops
This mod was initially developed by Saakra, a lone Mod Dev. He has since moved on due to IRL issues and handed over the reigns of development to me and Shalax.
